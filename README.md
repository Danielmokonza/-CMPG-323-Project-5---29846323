When dealing with major business projects it is important to be able to present findings and anaylse data neatly and efficiently.
In this project I have acquired data created from the connected Office dataset, scrubbed the data and created visualizations that should allow business partners to understand and analyzw the data easily using Power BI
Filters  o the right hand side allow the user to filter all presentations by zone of device, by date and by category.
Calculations under device were used to create most of the presentations and dataset used was from the sharepoint but not live.
